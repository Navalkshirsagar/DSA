## Problem statement
Given an array 'arr' of 'n' non-negative integers, your task is to move all the zeros to the end of the array while keeping the non-zero elements at the start of the array in their original order. Return the modified array.

## Example :
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘arr’ = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0]
